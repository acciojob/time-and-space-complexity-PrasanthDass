    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>
        Time complexity refers to the amount of computational time that an algorithm requires to solve a problem, especially as the input size increases. An efficient algorithm will have lower time complexity, meaning it can complete tasks more quickly as the data grows.

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> describes the total amount of memory that an algorithm needs to run, with common notations such as O(n) used to express how space requirements grow with input size. Considering Space Complexity is crucial for developing efficient software that scales well.
