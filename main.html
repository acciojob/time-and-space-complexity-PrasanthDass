  <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

  <p>
    Time complexity measures how the runtime of an algorithm changes with the size of the input. 
    It helps in understanding how efficient an algorithm is when processing large datasets.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory required by an algorithm to run to completion. 
    The term <b>Space Complexity</b> is often represented using notations like O(n) to analyze how memory usage grows 
    with input size.
